# ðŸ§  Todo Task Organizer (React + OpenAI)

This is a lightweight React application that transforms a user's freeform brain dump of tasks into a clean, prioritized task list using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API.

Built in a single focused evening, this project demonstrates:
- Full-stack (frontend + API) integration
- Async API handling with loading states and error management
- Secure environment variable usage for API keys
- Clean, functional component structure with React Hooks

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Textarea input for freeform brain dumping
- "Organize Tasks" button to submit
- Loading indicator during API processing
- Output display of organized, prioritized task list
- Basic error handling for failed API calls

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Vite / Create React App)
- **API:** OpenAI GPT-3.5 Chat Completions
- **Deployment:** Local development (optional cloud deploy ready)
- **Version Control:** GitHub

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project?

This project was built to demonstrate hands-on experience interacting with LLMs (Large Language Models) in a professional full-stack application, with a focus on clean development practices and rapid iteration.

It is part of a broader portfolio preparing for forward-deployed engineering roles working at the intersection of AI infrastructure and client-facing development.
